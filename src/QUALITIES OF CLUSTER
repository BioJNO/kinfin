QUALITIES OF CLUSTER
category ['group']
    - members => CBOT : {CBOT_A, CBOT_B}, CMPRL : {CMPRL1.2, CMPRL2.3}, notCMPRL : {CP1.2, CP3.1}
    - counts => CBOT : len(members[CBOT]), ...
    - perc => CBOT : len(members[CBOT]/total_CBOT), ...
    - type => singleton/monoton/multiton


INITIALISE Scheme for each cluster using CategoryObj
-

Proteins
- length : int
- cluster : str
- ranks : dict()

Cluster
- proteins : set of proteins
- ranks : dict of rank : set of members

RankSubsets : dict
- rank


# get clusters by percentage
    - limit above/below certain percentage, by type, by members: distribution, core, subsets
# sample proteins of rank and see how many new clusters are seen (rarefraction)
    - limit by type, limit by
# get counts for clusters/proteins
    -
# get clusters by subset
